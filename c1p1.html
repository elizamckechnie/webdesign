			<p>`Well!, after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, 
			even if I fell off the top of the house!’ 
			 </p>
			 
			 <p>Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! </p>
			 
			 <p>`I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time? I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.
			 Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think, yes, that’s about the right distance–but then I 
			 wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’
			 </p>


			 <p>`I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! 
			 The Antipathies, I think, but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia? 
			 And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’
