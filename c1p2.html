		<h1>Chapter 1 Part 2</h1>
		<p> Alice found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
		There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, 
		trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.
		</p>
	
		<p>Can you help Alice find her way through the doors?
		What a curious feeling!
		</p>
